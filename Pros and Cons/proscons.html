                        Overwhelming scientific consensus finds human activity primarily responsible for climate change.
                    According to many peer-reviewed studies, over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activity is extremely likely to be the cause of global climate change.  Most scientific organizations also support this view, including the American Medical Association and an international coalition of science academies. 
                    
                    A prominent review of 11,944 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found that only 78 studies (0.7%) explicitly rejected the idea of anthropogenic (resulting from human activity) global warming.  A separate review of 13,950 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found only 24 that rejected human-caused global warming.  An examination of scientific papers that didn’t agree that humans cause climate change found serious flaws and bias in their research.

                        A report found more than 1,000 scientists who disagreed that humans are primarily responsible for global climate change.  The claim that 97% of scientists agree on the cause of global warming is inaccurate. The research on 11,944 studies actually found that only 3,974 even expressed a view on the issue. Of those, just 64 (1.6%) said humans are the main cause. 
                        
                        A Purdue University survey found that 47% of climatologists challenge the idea that humans are primarily responsible for climate change and instead believe that climate change is caused by an equal combination of humans and the environment (37%), mostly by the environment (5%), or that there’s not enough information to say (5%).
