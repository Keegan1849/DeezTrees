                    According to many peer-reviewed studies, over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activity is extremely likely to be the cause of global climate change. Most scientific organizations also support this view, including the American Medical Association and an international coalition of science academies. A prominent review of 11,944 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found that only 78 studies (0.7%) explicitly rejected the idea of anthropogenic (resulting from human activity) global warming. A separate review of 13,950 peer-reviewed studies on climate change found only 24 that rejected human-caused global warming.   An examination of scientific papers that didnâ€™t agree that humans cause climate change found serious flaws and bias in their research.
